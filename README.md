# GenePredictionHMM
This repository implements a semi-Markov gene prediction pipeline based on probabilistic models combining intrinsic sequence features and structural priors. It includes utilities for data preparation, training, prediction, and evaluation of Hidden Semi-Markov Models (H(S)MM) for gene structure inference.
